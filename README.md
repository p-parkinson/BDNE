BDNE is code to connect to and explore the big-data for nano-electronics
dataset hosted on AWS. It allows retrieval of _measurements_ (results of _experiments_) for
_objects_ which are associated with unique _entities_ for different _samples_. Each
term is linked to a database table.

The database is designed to hold and store information for functional nanomaterials,
and to allow analysis of this data.
